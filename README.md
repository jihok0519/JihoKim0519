### Hi there, It's Enoch! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer interested in innovating and redesigning the next generation of video game development. I am currently learning Javascript but will soon be adding Django and Python to my arsenal of languages. You can catch me playing video games, watching/playing basketball, or listening to music in my spare time.
